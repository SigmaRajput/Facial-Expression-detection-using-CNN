Emotion Recognition and Deep Learning Techniques for Recognizing Emotions have been the subject of several studies and study. In the future, a model like this that is considerably more reliable and has endless possibilities in all disciplines will be necessary. This project attempted to solve emotion recognition difficulties using the inception net. Various databases have been investigated, with Kaggle's and JONATHAN OHEIX Emotional Faces serving as datasets for the study. The model is trained using Tensor Flow. It is possible to reach a 72 percent accuracy rate. A similar framework could be used to produce real-time emotion recognition in the future.!
